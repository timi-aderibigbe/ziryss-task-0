#  Profile Card Project 
    This project is part of the Frontend Wizards Stage 0 Task. It is a simple, responsive, and 
    accessible profile card built using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a touch of vanilla 
    JavaScript. The card includes important profile details like name, bio, avatar, hobbies, dislikes, 
    and social links, all designed to meet accessibility and responsiveness standards. 

# Overview 
  
    The profile card showcases how semantic HTML can be combined with CSS Flexbox and Grid 
    to create a clean, adaptive design that works well across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. 
    JavaScript is used to handle the live time display in milliseconds, which updates every second 
    to show the current timestamp.

# Features 
    
    • Semantic HTML structure for better accessibility and SEO 
    • Fully responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes 
    • Every visible element includes a data-testid attribute for automated testing 
    • Live time display using Date.now() in milliseconds 
    • Accessible keyboard navigation with visible focus styles 
    • Avatar image with descriptive alt text 
    • Social links open safely in a new tab with rel="noopener noreferrer"

# How to Run the Project 
    1. Clone the repository from GitHub or download the ZIP file. 
    2. Open the index.html file directly in your browser. 
    3. The card will render instantly with your name, bio, avatar, hobbies, dislikes, and current time 
    in milliseconds.

# Accessibility 
    This project follows basic accessibility practices such as: 
    Using semantic tags like <article>, <figure>, <nav>, and <section> 
    Providing alt text for images 
    Ensuring keyboard navigation is smooth and focusable 
    Using readable contrast ratios 
    Responsiveness 
    The layout is designed to adjust gracefully: 
    On mobile screens, content stacks vertically for readability. 
    On tablets and larger screens, the avatar is displayed on one side while the text content sits 
    beside it. 

# Credits 
        Created by a Aderibigbe Oluwatimilehin as part of the Frontend Bootcamp (Stage 0) 
        challenge of HNG13. The task focuses on building real-world, testable, and accessible web components 
        using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
