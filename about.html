          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Petroleum and Gas Engineer. <br>
            I am also a frontend engineer with a big passion for creating websites with creative and good designs. <br>
            I'm passionate about turning creative ideas into functional and
            accessible digital experiences with the use of technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside coding, I enjoy photography, gaming, and reading comics. I believe we can take inspirations from any and everything.

          <h3>Goals in HNG13</h3>
          <p>
            My main goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, gain hands-on
            experience working on real-world projects, and grow into a
            well-rounded full-stack developer who can handle both frontend and
            backend development with confidence. <br>
            As someone with previous experience from HNG9, 
            I know the oppurtunities that this program can give and I am ready to take those oppurtunities and make them into something beautiful.

          <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            As an engineering student, 
            I had to drop some of my hobbies to focus a bit on school work and that led to me not being as sharp and confident as i used to be. <br>
            An area I'm still trying to build my confidence in is my ability in designing APIs and managing database structures efficiently for
            larger-scale projects. <br> I'm also working on improving my understanding
            of advanced Frontend design patterns and testing best practices. And also how to work as a proffesional.

          <h3>Note to My Future Self</h3>
          <p>
            Never lose the excitement and zeal you had when you
            first built something that actually worked. And remember â€” consistency in
            progress beats perfection. Always be happy to code no matter the situation.

          <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            This journey is going to be one to remember and it would be a great stepping stone across my career. 
            The aim is to keep improving, refining my craft,
            exploring open-source contributions, and being one of the people to contribute to the development of the industry.
